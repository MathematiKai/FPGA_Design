No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>
