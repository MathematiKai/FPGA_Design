REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg has an input control pin system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg/WEA[0] (net: system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/write_enable) which is driven by a register (system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg has an input control pin system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg/WEA[0] (net: system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/write_enable) which is driven by a register (system_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/state_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.
